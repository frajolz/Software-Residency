# Software Residency (ResidÃªncia de Software)

This repository stores my projects, studies and progress in the Software Residency course.

The Software Residency is an initiative of SERRATEC, a society of IT companies in Brazil, in partnership with FAETERJ, SENAI, LNCC and others sponsors. It is an awesome course where we, the students, have the opportunity to develop skills both in classes and in company projects, being able to work in professional solutions since the beginning.

The course is focused in web development, divided in two parts. In the first one is the general Web Development foundation in front-end and back-end, using languages and tools like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PostgreSQL, DBeaver and SQLite. The second part, we will choose a stack to work. For this part of the course, I am aiming to develop React+React Native and Node.JS skills.

Feel free to ask me if you have any doubt!
